# Pomodoro Timer
A JavaFx Pomodoro application

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

I find it useful to utilise this so I decided I'd make a little application to put my Java to the test.

To do this I have used;
- Java and JavaFX.
- Scenebuilder to build the UI.

Current Status:
- The timer functions, it can play, pause and be reset.
- The GUI is simple.
- The timer alarms on the remaining time reaching 0 minutes and 0 seconds.
- The Main Pomodoro Scene and Break Pomodoro Scenes can be switched between and are controlled by seperate controllers

To do:
- Implement time worked tracking 
- Figure out how to automatically swtich scenes
